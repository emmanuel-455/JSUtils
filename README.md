In this example, we've created a self-contained JavaScript module that encapsulates a variety of utility functions under the JSUtils namespace. Developers can easily include this library in their projects and leverage its functionality to streamline their development process.

To expand this project further, additional utility functions and features can be added, documentation can be provided, and testing can be implemented to ensure reliability and robustness. This open-source library can then be hosted on platforms like GitHub, allowing other developers to contribute, provide feedback, and benefit from its capabilities.
